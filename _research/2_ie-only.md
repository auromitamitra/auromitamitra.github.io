title: "Presupposition and implicature in Indian English _only_"
excerpt: "Indian English allows for a use of _only_ that differs from its more well-known 'exclusive' use. This work attempts to explain certain non-entailed inferences of exclusivity that arise from the use of IE _only_ in terms of interactions between it's presuppositional meaning and Gricean implicatures."
