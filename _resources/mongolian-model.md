Khalka Mongolian Acoustic Model
==

Acoustic model for Khalkha Mongolian, trained on a corpus of 14 speakers (approx. 2 hours of speech) in [Kaldi](https://kaldi-asr.org/). Model and example output of forced alignment using the [Montreal Forced Aligner](https://montreal-forced-aligner.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#) can be found [here](https://github.com/auromitamitra/Mongolian_Acoustic_Model).

This is part of an ongoing [project](/research/mongolian) on vowel harmony and coarticulation in Khalka Mongolian at the [Speech Dynamics lab](https://duttalab.github.io) at Jadavpur University, Kolkata.
