Khalka Mongolian Acoustic Model
==

Acoustic model for Khalka Mongolian, trained on a corpus of 14 speakers (approx. 2 hours of speech) in Kaldi. Model and example output of forced alignment using the Montreal Forced Aligner can be found [here](https://github.com/auromitamitra/Mongolian_Acoustic_Model).

This is part of an ongoing <a href="../../_research/mongolian.md" target="_blank">project</a>
on vowel harmony and coarticulation in Khalka Mongolian at the [Speech Dynamics lab](https://duttalab.github.io/indranil.html) at Jadavpur University, Kolkata.
