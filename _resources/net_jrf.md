Resources for NET-JRF Linguistics
==

I conducted a workshop on preparing for the NET-JRF Linguistics exam at Jadavpur University in September 2021. These are slides from the workshop. They are not very spelt-out because they were meant to go with the talk, but hopefully the points come across, and they have links to some free online materials that might be useful, especially if you are pressed for time.

Because there aren't many resources for NET paper 2 in Linguistics, I'm planning to put up more material here, inluding (hopefully) unit-wise notes. Please get in touch if you have suggestions or want to contribute!


If you are a student looking for more resources or have questions about the exam, drop me an email at [auromita.mitra@gmail.com](auromita.mitra@gmail.com), and I'll do my best to help!
