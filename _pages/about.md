Hi! I'm an incoming Ph.D. student at NYU Linguistics (starting September 2022). I recently graduated with an M.A. in Linguistics from the English and Foreign Languages University (EFLU), Hyderabad.

I'm curious about all things language. It is something that most people are very good at, without much effort at all. And yet there is a lot about our ability to use lanuage that we still don't understand. This is exciting, because it means that we get to ask some fundamental questions about what makes us human, how our brains and bodies and societies work, by looking more closely at something that we do all the time. 

I enjoy thinking about the complex ways in which we use language in real social contexts, and what that can tell us about how lanuage as a 'system' exists in the mind. Most people around the world know and use multiple languages-- this makes multilingual settings a particularly exciting place to look into this. Over the last two years, I have been working on variation in bilingual speech. More recently I've dabbled in the semantics of the copula/aspect system of Bangla, and vowel harmony in Khalka Mongolian. More on my research [here](research.html).

I believe that open science practices are important, and that findings of linguistic research should be accessible to the communities whose language data makes up the substance of our work. [This page](research.html) has non-specialist summaries of completed and ongoing projects, along with links to data and code.

Questions, thoughts, and reflections on miscellanous linguistic topics [here](year-archive.html).

[These](resources.html) are some resources including notes, scripts, a word-finding tool to generate items for psycholinguistic experiments, and an acoustic model for Khalkha Mongolian. 

Outside of linguistics, I love animals of all kinds, painting, and being outdoors. I also foray into the occasional cooking experiment and haven't blown anything up (as of now).
