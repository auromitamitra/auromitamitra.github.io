Hi! I'm a first-year Ph.D. student at NYU Linguistics. I recently graduated with an M.A. in Linguistics from the English and Foreign Languages University (EFLU), Hyderabad.

I'm curious about all things language. I enjoy thinking about the complex ways in which we use language in real communicative contexts, and what that can tell us about how lanuage as a 'system' exists in the brain. Most people around the world know and use multiple languages-- this makes multilingual settings a particularly exciting place to look into this. Over the last two years, I have been working on variation and accommodation in bilingual speech. More recently I've dabbled in the semantics of the copula/aspect system of Bangla, and vowel harmony in Khalka Mongolian. More on my research [here](research.html).

I believe that open science practices are important, and that findings of linguistic research should be accessible to the communities whose language data makes up the substance of our work. [This page](research.html) has layman summaries of completed and ongoing projects, along with links to data and code.

Questions, thoughts, and reflections on miscellanous linguistic topics [here](year-archive.html).

[These](resources.html) are some resources including notes, scripts, a word-finding tool to generate items for psycholinguistic experiments, and an acoustic model for Khalkha Mongolian. 

Outside of linguistics, I love animals of all kinds, painting, and being outdoors. I also venture into the occasional cooking experiment and haven't blown anything up (as of now).
