Hi! I'm a student of M.A. Linguistics at The English and Foreign Languages University (EFLU), Hyderabad.

I'm curious about all things language. Language is central to almost every part of our lives. It is also something that most people are very good at without much effort at all. But there is a lot about our ability to use language that we don't understand yet. This is exciting, because it means that we get to ask some fundamental questions about what makes us human, how our brains and bodies and societies work, by looking closely at something that is all around us. 

I enjoy thinking about the complex ways in which we use language in real social settings, and what that can tell us about how lanuage as a 'system' exists in the mind. Most people around the world know more than one language. This makes language-use in multilingual persons and societies a particularly exciting place to look into this. Over the last two years, I have been working on the phonetics of bilingual speech. More recently I've dabbled in the semantics of the copula/aspect system of Bangla. More on my research [here](portfolio.html).

I believe that open science practices are important and that the findings of linguistic (and all other kinds of) research should be accessible to the communities whose language data makes up the substance of our work. [This page](portfolio.html) has non-specialist summaries of completed and ongoing projects, along with links to data and code.

Questions, thoughts, and reflections on miscellanous linguistic topics [here](year-archive.html).

[These](portfolio.html) are some resources including notes, scripts, and a word-finding tool to generate items for psycholinguistic experiments that is a work-in-progress. If you are interested in contributing to the code, making improvements, expanding it to other languages (it currently works with a Bangla corpus), or have any feedback, please reach out!

Beyond linguistics, I love animals of all kinds, making art, and being outdoors. I also foray into occasional cooking experiments, and haven't blown anything up as of now.
