Hi! I'm a second-year Ph.D. student in the Linguistics department at New York University (NYU) working with <a href="https://wp.nyu.edu/lisa_davidson/" target="_blank">Lisa Davidson</a> and <a href= "https://champollion.com/" target="_blank">Lucas Champollion</a>. Prior to this, I graduated from the English and Foreign Languages University (EFLU), Hyderabad. 

I'm curious about all things language. I enjoy thinking about the complex ways in which we use language in real communicative contexts, and what that can tell us about how lanuage as a 'system' exists in the brain. Most people around the world use multiple languages-- this makes multilingual settings a particularly exciting place to look into this. Over the last few years, I have been working on variation and accommodation in multilingual speech. Specifically, I'm interested in thinking about cross-language influence in speech as a complex and communicatively useful adaptive behavior, rather than a problem that needs to be 'fixed'. 
My other major thread of research concerns how languages express meanings related to time and modality (possibilities, necessity, etc). I'm especially interested in how these are conceptually linked to each other, and how that affects their linguistic expressions in the grammar. I have been looking into this using data from the tense-aspect system and conditional constructions in Indo-Aryan languages, especially Bangla.
Other questions I've worked on recently include the meaning of the Indian English _only_, and vowel harmony in Khalkha Mongolian. A common thread in most of these questions is how linguistic, cognitive, and contextual factors interact to constrain variation in language. I enjoy working with different types of data and methodologies, and I am passionate about having more conversations across (sub)disciplinary boundaries. More on my research [here](research.html).

I believe that open science practices are important, and that findings of linguistic research should be accessible to the communities whose data makes up the substance of our work, i.e. real people who use langauge in real societies. [This page](research.html) has non-specialist summaries of completed and ongoing projects, along with links to data and code. [These](resources.html) are some resources I have created, including notes and scripts, a word-finding tool to generate items for psycholinguistic experiments, and an acoustic model for Khalkha Mongolian. 

Outside of linguistics, I love animals of all kinds, painting, and being outdoors. In many Bengali households, children are given two (sometimes more), phonetically unrelated names-- an official _bhalo_ 'good' name, and a _daknaam_ `the name by which one is called' (translation from Jhumpa Lahiri's _The Namesake_, one of my favorite books). Mine is Disha, and I prefer to go by that.
